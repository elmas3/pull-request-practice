She put my name with yellow hearts
Her favorite color, like the stars
I didn't listen very hard
When she told me she was crazy from the start
She put my name with yellow hearts (Yeah, she did)
I said she was a work of art (Work of art)
I didn't listen very hard (Very hard, no, no)
When she told me she was crazy from the start
