Hello Ladies and Gentlemen! welcome to episode one of Jermacraft! 
the series where I play minecraft, this is going to be a single player let's play, 
and when I say "let's play" I use that term pretty loosely because I am an idiot in this game. 
You're gonna see lots of fails, your gonna see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping,
so go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of coco.
I got apple cider right here freshly brewed. Let me take a sip, ah that's some good cider!
